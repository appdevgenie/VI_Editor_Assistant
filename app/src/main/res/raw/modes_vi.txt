vi Editor has two modes: Command Mode and Insert Mode. 

The editor starts in Command Mode, unlike most word processors.
The editor switches to Insert Mode once commands such as insert and append are used.

The [Esc] Escape button is used to return to Command Mode.
[Esc] Escape is not a toggle, therefore it may be pressed a number of times to ensure that the editor has returned to Command Mode
