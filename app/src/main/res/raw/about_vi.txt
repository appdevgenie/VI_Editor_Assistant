The vi Editor is a text based editor used in Linux and Unix for editing configuration files and creating text documents. 
vi Editor is case sensitive, so ensure that [Caps lock] is off before starting. 

Most commands execute when typed except "line-orientated commands" that execute once the return [Enter] is pressed.
The "line-orientated commands" contain:

":" [colon]

"!" [exclamation mark]

"/" [slash]

"?" [question mark]

In addition to displaying information and errors, the last line on the screen is also used to display the input for "line-orientated commands" ("/", "?", ":" and "!").
When a "line-oriented command" is executed, the editor will enter text input mode on the last line of the screen, using the respective command characters as prompt characters.
